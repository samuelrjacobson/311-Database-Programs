# 311-Database-Programs

These programs all store a database of student information, including last name, first name, and ID#. Each program allows the user to add, find, and delete student records and display them in ascending and descending order by each attribute (last name, first name, and ID#).

The programs differ by which data structures they use:
Program 1 uses OrderedArrays.
Program 2 uses Double-Ended Doubly Linked Lists.
Program 3 uses Binary Search Trees.
One version of Program 3 uses recursive traversals and does not use threading; the other uses loops and implements threading.
