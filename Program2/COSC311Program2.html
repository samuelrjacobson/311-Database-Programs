Basically,    you are to repeat assignment #1 but change the underlying data    structure to a double ended doubly-linked list. Data records should be    added to the end of the main array (the database) and three double    ended doubly linked lists should be maintained ; one each for the ID,    LastName and FirstName. The linked lists should (of course) be    maintained in order!!<br>    <br>    <br>    You MUST use the driver program I have provided , and make some    additions. Remember, you should NOT be permitted to add a record with a    duplicate index number. You MUST implement all methods as I have    indicated.<br>    <br>    Printing out the data in forward order should use the "next" link in    each node, printing out in reverse order should employ the "prev" link.    <br>    <br>    <big><big>NOTE:<br>        <br>        When printing out records, print out ALL fields (ID, first name and        last name</big></big>).<br>    <br>    <big><big>NOTE2:<br>        <br>        You would do well to start on this program early</big></big>!!  </body></html>
